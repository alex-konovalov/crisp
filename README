The share package CRISP provides algorithms for computing subgroups of
finite solvable groups related to a group class C. In particular, it
allows to compute C-radicals and C-injectors for Fitting classes (and
Fitting sets) C, C-residuals for formations C, and C-projectors for
Schunck classes C. In order to carry out these computations, the group
class C must be represented by an algorithm which can decide membership
in the group class. Moreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the
computation of normal subgroups belonging to a given group class,
including an improved method to compute the set of all normal subgroups
of a finite solvable group.
