                    The CRISP share package
                          Version 1.1

The GAP package CRISP provides algorithms for computing subgroups of
finite solvable groups related to a group class C. In particular, it
allows to compute C-radicals and C-injectors for Fitting classes (and
Fitting sets) C, C-residuals for formations C, and C-projectors for
Schunck classes C. In order to carry out these computations, the group
class C must be represented by an algorithm which can decide membership
in the group class. 

Moreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the computation of normal subgroups 
invariant under a prescribed set of automorphisms and belonging to a given 
group class.

This includes an improved method to compute the set of all normal subgroups 
of a finite solvable group, its characteristic subgroups, and the socle and 
p-socles for given primes p.

This version of CRISP requires at least GAP 4.2 with bugfixes 1 to 8 installed.

In order to install CRISP, you have to get the archive file `crisp-1r1.zoo'.

You can download `crisp-1r1.zoo' from the same places as GAP. The main FTP
servers are:

ftp://ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.math.rwth-aachen.de/pub/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/mirrors/ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://pell.anu.edu.au/pub/algebra/gap4/share/

`crisp-1r1.zoo' is also available via the GAP www page at

http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/Info4/share.html
http://aldebaran.math.rwth-aachen.de/~GAP/Info4/share.html
http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/GAP/NEU/Info4/share.html
http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/research.groups/algebra/GAP/www/Info4/share.html

or, alternatively, from the author's home page at

http://www.tu-bs.de/~bhoeflin/crisp/index.html

To install CRISP, move the file `crisp-1r1.zoo' into the `pkg' directory in
which you plan to install CRISP. Usually, this will be the directory `pkg'
in the GAP directory. 

If you already have a previous version of CRISP, that is, there is a directory
`crisp' in the `pkg' directory, delete (or rename) this directory first.

Then unzoo `crisp-1r1.zoo' by starting `unzoo' and type

    -x crisp-1r1

(and <return>) at the prompt. (To quit `unzoo', enter <return> when the prompt
re-appears.)

That's all. Now start GAP and type

    RequirePackage ("crisp");

The CRISP banner should appear on the screen.
