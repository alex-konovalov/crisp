The package CRISP provides algorithms for computing subgroups of
finite solvable groups related to a group class C. In particular, it
allows to compute C-radicals and C-injectors for Fitting classes (and
Fitting sets) C, C-residuals for formations C, and C-projectors for
Schunck classes C. In order to carry out these computations, the group
class C must be represented by an algorithm which can decide membership
in the group class. Moreover, CRISP contains algorithms for the
computation of normal subgroups belonging to a given group class,
including an improved method to compute the set of all normal subgroups
of a finite solvable group.

In order to install CRISP, you have to get the archive file `crisp.zoo'.

You can download `crisp.zoo' from the same places as GAP. The main FTP 
servers are:

ftp://ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.math.rwth-aachen.de/pub/gap4/share/
ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/mirrors/ftp-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/pub/gap/gap4/share/
ftp://pell.anu.edu.au/pub/algebra/gap4/share/

`crisp.zoo' is also available via the GAP www page at

http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~gap/Info4/share.html
http://aldebaran.math.rwth-aachen.de/~GAP/Info4/share.html
http://mirrors.ccs.neu.edu/GAP/NEU/Info4/share.html
http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/research.groups/algebra/GAP/www/Info4/share.html

or, alternatively, from the author's home page at

http://www.minet.uni-jena.de/~hoefling/crisp/htm/index.htm

To install CRISP, move the file `crisp.zoo' into the `pkg' directory in 
which you plan to install CRISP. Usually, this will be the directory `pkg'
in the GAP directory. 

Then unzoo `crisp.zoo' by 

   unzoo -x crisp

That's all. Now start GAP and type

   RequirePackage ("crisp");

The CRISP banner should appear on the screen.
