<h1>4.1 Creating Schunck classes</h1><p>
<p>
<a name = "I2"></a>

A class <var>cal C</var> of finite groups is a <strong>Schunck class</strong> if a finite group
<var>G</var> belongs to <var>cal C</var> if and only if all its primitive factor groups
belong to <var>cal C</var>. In particular, a Schunck class is nonempty and closed
with respect to factor groups. By definition, a Schunck class <var>cal C</var> is
determined by the primitive groups which it contains (the basis of <var>cal C</var>),
or by the primitive groups not in <var>cal C</var> but all of whose proper factor
groups belong to <var>cal C</var> (the boundary of <var>cal C</var>).

<li><code>SchunckClass(</code><var>rec</var><code>) O</code>
<p>
returns a Schunck class defined by the information stored in the record
<var>rec</var>. Note that it is the user's responsibility to ensure that <var>rec</var> really
defines a Schunck class. <var>rec</var> may have the following components: <code>\in</code>,
<code>proj</code>, <code>bound</code>, <code>char</code>, and <code>name</code>. The values bound to these entries, if
present, are stored, respectively, in the attributes <code>MemberFunction</code>, <code>ProjectorFunction</code>,
<code>BoundaryFunction</code>, <code>Characteristic</code>, and <code>Name</code>.
<p>
At least one of the attributes <code>MemberFunction</code>, <code>ProjectorFunction</code>, 
<code>BoundaryFunction</code>, must be present in order to be able to compute
with a Schunck class.
