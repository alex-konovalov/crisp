<h1>3 Generic group classes</h1><p>
<p>
In this chapter, we describe how group classes can be defined by assigning
basic attributes and properties, in particular closure properties. 
<p>
A class (see <a href="C002S000.htm">Set theoretical classes</a>) is a <strong>group class</strong> if it consists of
groups, and if it is closed under isomorphisms of groups. Thus if <font size="+1"><i>G</i></font> and
<font size="+1"><i>H</i></font> are isomorphic groups,  then <font size="+1"><i>G</i></font> is in the group class <var>grpclass</var> if and
only if
<font size="+1"><i>H</i></font> is. Groups belonging to the same group class may be regarded as sharing
a group theoretical property (a property shared by isomorphic groups), and
groups sharing a group theoretical property form a class of groups. It
not empty, group classes are genuinely infinite objects, so <font face="helvetica,arial">GAP</font> sets can
never form group classes. Some authors require every group class to contain
the trivial groups. Here we do not make this assumption; in particular every
empty class is a group class.
<p>
The following sections describe how to create group classes and
declare some of their basic properties. 
<p>
Note that,
for common types of group classes, there are additional functions available
to accomplish this task; see the following Chapters <a href="C004S000.htm">Schunck classes and formations</a> and <a href="C005S000.htm">Fitting classes and Fitting sets</a>. There are also a number
of pre-defined group classes; see Chapter&nbsp;<a href="C006S000.htm">Examples of group classes</a>.
