<h1>2 Set theoretical classes</h1><p>
<p>
In CRISP, a class (in the set-theoretical sense) is usually represented
by an algorithm which decides membership in that class. Wherever this makes
sense, sets (see <a href="../../../doc/htm/ref/C028S002.htm">Set</a> in the <font face="helvetica,arial">GAP</font> reference
manual) may also be used as classes.
