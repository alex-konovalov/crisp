\Chapter{Examples of group classes}

This chapter describes some pre-defined 
group classes, namely the classes of all abelian, nilpotent, and supersolvable
groups. Moreover, there are some functions constructing the classes of all
$p$-groups, $\pi$-groups, and abelian groups whose exponent divides a given
positive integer. 

The definitions of these group classes can also serve as further examples of
how group classes can be defined using the methods described in the preceding
chapters.

\>`TrivialGroups'{class}!{of all trivial groups} V

\index{trivial groups!class of}%
The global variable `TrivialGroups' contains the class of all trivial groups. It is a
subgroup closed saturated Fitting formation.

\>`NilpotentGroups'{class}!{of all nilpotent groups} V

\index{nilpotent groups!class of}%
This global variable contains the class of all finite nilpotent groups. It is a
subgroup closed saturated Fitting formation.

\>NilpotentProjector(<grp>) A

\index{Carter subgroup}%
This function returns a projector for the class of all finite nilpotent
groups. For a definition, see "Projector". Note that the nilpotent projectors
of a finite soluble group equal its a Carter subgroups, that is, its
self-normalizing nilpotent subgroups. 

\>`SupersolvableGroups'{class}!{of all supersolvable groups} V

\index{supersolvable groups!class of}%
This global variable contains the class of all finite supersolvable groups. It
is a subgroup closed saturated formation.

\>SupersolvableProjector(<grp>) A

These functions return a projector for the class of all finite supersolvable
groups. For a definition, see "Projector". 

\>`AbelianGroups'{class}!{of all abelian groups} V

\index{abelian groups!class of}%
is the class of all abelian groups. It is a subgroup closed formation.

\>AbelianGroupsOfExponent(<n>) F

returns the class of all abelian groups of exponent dividing <n>, 
where <n> is
a positive integer. It is always a subgroup-closed formation.


\>PiGroups(<pi>) F

constructs the class of all <pi>-groups.  <pi> may be a non-empty class or a
set of primes. The result is a subgroup-closed saturated Fitting formation.


\>PGroups(<p>) F

returns the class of all <p>-groups, where <p> is a prime.  The result is a
subgroup-closed saturated Fitting formation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Pre-defined sets of primes}

\>`AllPrimes'{set}!{of all primes} V

\index{primes!set of all}%
\label{AllPrimes}%
is the set of all (integral) primes. This should be
installed as value for `Characteristic(<grpclass>)' if the group class
<grpclass> contains cyclic groups of prime order~$p$ for arbitrary primes $p$.
