\Chapter{Fitting classes and Fitting sets}

In this chapter, you will find information on how to create 
Fitting classes and Fitting sets (see "Creating Fitting classes" and
"Creating Fitting sets" below), and how to compute injectors and radicals
with respect to these;  see "Attributes and operations for Fitting classes
and Fitting sets".


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Creating Fitting classes}

Recall that a Fitting class is a nonempty group class which is closed with respect
to normal subgroups and joins of subnormal subgroups.

\>FittingClass(<rec>) O

returns the Fitting class <fitclass> defined by the entries of the record
<rec>. <rec> may have components `\\in', `inj', `rad', and `name'. The
functions assigned to the components are stored in the attributes
`MemberFunction' (see "MemberFunction"), `InjectorFunction',
`RadicalFunction', and `Name', of <fitclass>. The functions bound to `inj' and
`rad' must have one argument, <H>, and return an <fitclass>-injector and the
<fitclass>-radical of <H>, respectively.


\beginexample
gap> myNilpotentGroups := FittingClass(rec(\in := IsNilpotent,
>    rad := FittingSubgroup));
FittingClass (in=<Operation "IsNilpotent">, rad=<Operation "FittingSubgroup">) 
gap> myTwoGroups := FittingClass(rec(\in := G -> IsSubset([2], Set(Factors(Size(G)))),
>    rad :=  G -> PCore(G,2),
>    inj := G -> SylowSubgroup(G,2)));
FittingClass (in=function( G ) ... end, rad=function( G ) ... end, inj=functio\
n( G ) ... end)
\endexample

\>FittingProduct(<fit1>, <fit2>) O

returns the Fitting product <prod> of the Fitting classes <fit1> and <fit2>,
i.~e., the class of all groups G such that G/R is  an <fit2>-group, where R
is the <fit1>-radical of G.  <prod> is again a Fitting class.
Note that if <fit1> and <fit2> are also
formations, then <prod> equals the
formation product of <fit1> and <fit2>; see "FormationProduct".

\beginexample
gap> FittingProduct (myNilpotentGroups, myTwoGroups);
FittingClass (in=function( G ) ... end, rad=function( G ) ... end)
\endexample

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Fitting formations}

Fitting formations are Fitting classes which are also formations.

\>FittingFormation(<rec>) O

creates a Fitting formation from the record <rec>. <rec> may have any
components admissible for saturated formations (see "SaturatedFormation") or
Fitting classes (see "FittingClass"), that is, `\\in', `res', `char', `rad',
`inj', and `name', 
 whose values are stored in the attributes `MemberFunction',
`ResidualFunction', `Characteristic',  `RadicalFunction',
`InjectorFunction',  and `Name', respectively.

\>SaturatedFittingFormation(<rec>) O

creates a Fitting formation from the record <rec>. <rec> may have any
components admissible for saturated formations (see "SaturatedFormation") or
Fitting classes (see "FittingClass"), that is, `\\in', `res', `char', `proj',
`bound', `locdef', `rad', `inj',  and `Name', whose values are stored in the
attributes `MemberFunction', `ResidualFunction', `Characteristic', 
`ProjectorFunction' and `BoundaryFunction',  `LocalDefinitionFunction',
`RadicalFunction', `InjectorFunction', and `Name', respectively.

\Section{Creating Fitting sets}

A nonempty set $\cal F$ of subgroups of a group $G$ is a *Fitting set of
$G$*  if it satisfies the following properties:

\beginlist
\item{(1)} if $H$ belongs to $\cal F$ and $K$ is normal in $H$, then $K$ 
           belongs to $\cal F$;
         
\item{(2)} if $H$ and $K$ belong to $\cal F$, and $H$ and $K$ are normal in
$\langle H, K \rangle$, then $\langle H, K \rangle = H K$ belongs to $\cal
F$;
         
\item{(3)} if $H$ is in $\cal F$ and $g \in G$, then $H^g$ also belongs to 
           $\cal F$.
\endlist

Note that a Fitting set <fitset> of the group~$G$ is a subset of the set of all
subgroups of~$G$. Therefore it is not closed under group
isomorphisms, hence  is *not* a group class. If $H$ is a subgroup of $G$, then the
subgroups of $G$ in <fitset> which are contained in $H$ form a Fitting set of $H$.
We will not distinguish between <fitset> and the arising Fitting set of $H$. 
Moreover, if  <fit> is a Fitting class and <grp> is a group, then the set of all
subgroups of <grp> which belong to <fit> is a Fitting set of <grp>.

\>IsFittingSet(<fitset>, <G>) O

tests whether <fitset> (or, more precisely, the set of all subgroups of $G$
which are contained in  <fitset>) is a Fitting set of the group <G>. Thus if
<fitset> is a Fitting class, or if
<G> is a subgroup of the group <H> and <fitset> is a Fitting set of <H>,
then `IsFittingSet(<fitset>, <G>)' will return `true'.

\>FittingSet(<G>, <rec>) O

returns the Fitting set <fitset> of the group <G>, defined by the entries of the
record <rec>. <rec> may have components `\\in', `inj', `rad', and `name'. The
functions assigned to the components are stored in the attributes
`MemberFunction' (see "MemberFunction"), `InjectorFunction', 
`RadicalFunction', and `Name', of <fitset>. The latter functions must have one
argument, <H>, which will be a subgroup of <G>, and return an <fitset>-injector
and the <fitset>-radical of <H>, respectively.

Note that at present, every Fitting set has to be a class (see "Set theoretical
classes"). The second example below shows how to define a Fitting set from 
a list of subgroups.


\beginexample
gap> G := SymmetricGroup(4);;V := PCore(G,2);;
gap> fitset := FittingSet(G, rec(\in := S -> IsSubgroup(V, S),
> rad := S -> Intersection(V, S),
> inj := S -> Intersection(V, S)));
FittingSet (SymmetricGroup( 
[ 1 .. 4 ] ), rec (in=function( S ) ... end, rad=function( S ) ... end, inj=fu\
nction( S ) ... end))
gap> FittingSet (SymmetricGroup (3), rec(
> \in := H -> H in [Group (()), Group ((1,2)), Group ((1,3)), Group ((2,3))]));
FittingSet (SymmetricGroup( [ 1 .. 3 ] ), rec (in=function( H ) ... end))
\endexample

\>ImageFittingSet(<alpha>, <fitset>) O

returns the image <F_1> of the Fitting set <fitset> under the group homomorphism 
<alpha>, i.e.
the Fitting set <F_1> of `Image(<alpha>)' which consists of all subgroups
`<alpha>(<S>)' of `Image(<alpha>)' such that <S> is an <fitset>-injector of 
`PreImage(<alpha>, <S>)'. <fitset> must be a Fitting set of `PreImage(<alpha>)'
or a Fitting class.  Note that the image of a Fitting class is a
Fitting set but not a Fitting class.

\beginexample
gap> alpha := GroupHomomorphismByImages (G, SymmetricGroup (3),
>  [(1,2), (1,3), (1,4)], [(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)]);;
gap> ImageFittingSet (alpha, fitset);
FittingSet (Group( [ (1,2), (1,3), (2,3) ] ), rec (inj=function( G ) ... end))
\endexample

\>PreImageFittingSet(<alpha>, <fitset>) O

returns the preimage <fitset_0> of the Fitting set <fitset> of `Image(<alpha>)' under the group homomorphism <alpha>. It consists of all
subgroups <S> of `PreImage(<alpha>)' which are subnormal in `PreImage(<alpha>, <T>)' for some <T> in <fitset>. <fitset> must be a Fitting set of
`Image(<alpha>)' or a Fitting class. 

Note that the preimage of a Fitting class is just a Fitting set but 
not a Fitting class.

Moreover, `ImageFittingSet(PreImageFittingSet(<fitset>, <alpha>),
<alpha>)' equals <fitset> but in general, <fitset> is not contained in
`PreImageFittingSet(ImageFittingSet(<fitset>, <alpha>), <alpha>)'; see
e.g. Example VIII,~2.16 of~\cite{DH1992}.

\>Intersection(<fitset1>, <fitset2>)!{of Fitting sets}

Let <fitset1> and <fitset2> be Fitting sets of the groups <G1> and <G2>. 
Then the intersection of <fitset1> and <fitset2> will be a Fitting set of the 
intersection of <G1> and <G2>, provided that <G1> and <G2> lie in some 
common supergroup.

\beginexample
gap> F1 := FittingSet (SymmetricGroup (3),
> rec (\in := IsNilpotent, rad := FittingSubgroup));
FittingSet (SymmetricGroup( 
[ 1 .. 3 ] ), rec (in=<Operation "IsNilpotent">, rad=<Operation "FittingSubgro\
up">))
gap> F2 := FittingSet (AlternatingGroup (4),
> rec (\in := ReturnTrue, rad := H -> H));
FittingSet (AlternatingGroup( 
[ 1 .. 4 ] ), rec (in=function(  ) ... end, rad=function( H ) ... end))
gap> F := Intersection (F1, F2);
FittingSet (Group( 
[ (1,2,3) ] ), rec (in=function( x ) ... end, rad=function( G ) ... end))
\endexample

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\Section{Attributes and operations for Fitting classes and Fitting sets}

In addition to operations applicable to classes, both Fitting sets and
Fitting classes admit the following attributes and operations. Of course,
Fitting classes, being group classes, also admit all properties and
attributes for group classes.

\>RadicalFunction(<class>) A

This attribute stores a function which computes the <grpclass>-radical of a
given group. In general, such a radical only exists if <grpclass> is closed
with respect to products of normal subgroups; cf. `IsNormalProductClosed'.

\>InjectorFunction(<class>) A

If bound, `InjectorFunction' stores a function taking a group $G$ as the
only argument and returning a <grpclass>-injector of $G$.


\>Radical(<G>,  <fitset>)

\index{radical!wrt Fitting class}%
\index{radical!wrt Fitting set}%
returns the <grpclass>-radical of the group <G>, where
<fitset> is a Fitting set of <G> (see "IsFittingSet"), or a Fitting
class. The <fitset>-radical of <G> is the unique largest normal subgroup
of <G> belonging to <fitset>. Note that `Radical(<G>)' returns the solvable
radical of a group <G> (see "ref:RadicalGroup" in the {\GAP} reference
manual).

\beginexample
gap> Radical (SymmetricGroup (4), FittingClass (rec(\in := IsNilpotentGroup)));
Group([ (1,4)(2,3), (1,3)(2,4) ])
\endexample

\>Injector(<G>, <fitset>).

returns a <grpclass>-injector of the group <G>, where <fitset> is a
Fitting set of <G> (or a group containing <G>), or a Fitting class. A
subgroup $H$ of $G$ is a <fitset>-injector of <G> if $S \cap H$ is
<fitset>-maximal in $S$ for every subnormal subgroup $S$ of $G$. Note that by 
\cite{DH1992}, VIII,~2.9, all <fitset>-injectors of <G> are conjugate in $G$,
and it is not hard to see that every subgroup of <G> has <fitset>-injectors
if and only if <fitset> is a Fitting set of <G>. In particular, if <fitset>
is a group class, then every finite
soluble group has <fitset>-injectors if and only if <fitset> is a Fitting class;
see \cite{DH1992}, IX,~1.4.

\beginexample
gap> Injector (SymmetricGroup (4), FittingClass (rec(\in := IsNilpotentGroup)));
Group([ (1,3)(2,4), (1,4)(2,3), (3,4) ])

\Section{Functions for normal subgroups related to radicals}

\>OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty(<grp>, <pretest>, <test>, <data>) O

Let $\cal X$ be a set of normal subgroups of <grp> containing the trivial
subgroup of <grp>, and assume that whenever
$M$ and $N$ are normal subgroups with $M \in \cal X$ and $M$
containing $N$, then also $N \in \cal X$. Then
`OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty' computes a normal subgroup $M \in \cal X$
such that no normal subgroup of <grp> properly containing $M$ belongs to $\cal
X$. 

For example, every Fitting set $\cal X$ satisfies the above properties. In
this case, `OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty' will return the $\cal
X$-radical of <grp>.

The class $\cal X$ is described by two functions, <pretest> and <test>. 
<pretest> is a function taking four arguments, <U>, <V>, <R>, and <data>,
where <data> is just the argument passed to
`OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty'. $<U>/<V>$ is a chief factor of <grp>,
and  <R> is a normal subgroup of <grp> which is known to belong to $\cal X$.

<pretest> may return the values `true', `false', or `fail'. If it returns 
`true', every normal subgroup <N> of <grp> such that $<N>/R>$ is $G$-isomorphic
with $<U>/<V>$ must belong to
$\cal X$. If it returns `false', no such <N> may belong to to $\cal X$. 

<test> is a function taking three arguments, <S>, <R>, and <data>, where
data has been described above. <R> is a normal subgroup of <grp> belonging to
$\cal X$, and $<S>/<R>$ is a chief factor of <grp>. The function must return
true if <S> belongs to $\cal X$, and false otherwise. 

Note that <test> is never called if `pretest(U, V, R)' has returned `true' or
`false' for a chief factor $<U>/<V>$ which is G-isomorphic with $<S>/<R>$.
Thus if <pretest> always returns `true' or `false', <test> will not be
called at all.

<data> is never used or changed by `OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty', but
exists only as a means for passing additional information to or between
the functions <pretest> and <test>.


\>AllNormalSubgroupsWithNProperty(<grp>, <pretest>, <test>, <data>)

returns a list consisting of all normal subgroups of <grp> belonging 
to the class $\cal X$ described by <pretest>, <test>, and <data>. See
the documentation of `OneNormalSubgroupMaxWrtNProperty' above for details.

\beginexample
